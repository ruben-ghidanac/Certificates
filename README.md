Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ruben, and I will try to describe my self in the rows below.

I'm a person with a teamwork spirit highly accentuated, developed in dental laboratory for more than 4 years, where the teamwork was, and it is, a must.

Likewise, I love the digital field, data manipulation and logical thinking state, that brings me into data science.

During WBS Coding School period, I've learned new skills like: 

- Data Analysis with Python (Pandas)
- Data Visualization with Python (Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL querying and database modelling
- Data Storytelling with Tableau
- Cloud Computing and Automation (AWS:RDS, Lambda, CloudWatch)
- Data collection with Python (requests, beautifulsoup)
- A/B Testing
- Unsupervised Machine Learning (K-Means, clustering)
- Supervised Machine Learning (Scikit-Learn)
- Recommender Systems
