Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Ruben, and I will try to describe my self in the rows below.

I'm a person with a teamwork spirit highly accentuated, developed in dental laboratory for more than 4 years, where the teamwork was, and it is, a must. I was needing to maintain a tight relation about every patient case with the laboratory team and with dentist team also.

Likewise, I love the digital field, data manipulation and logical thinking state, that brings me into data science.

During WBS Coding School period, I've learned new skills like: 
- Python
- MySQL
- AWS RDS
- Pipelines and Pipelines on the Cloud
- Unsupervised Machine Learning
- Supervised Machine Learning
   - Classification
   - Regression 

I can mention some of our project during the WBS Coding School period, like: 
- Data Engineering: Pipelines on the Cloud;
- Unsupervised Machine Learning: Clustering Songs;
- Supervised Machine Learning: 
   - Classification of Housing Expensiveness
   - Predicting Housing Prices
